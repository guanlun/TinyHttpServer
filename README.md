# tiny-http-server
As a web developer, I need to understand how some HTTP features (caching, MIME-types, etc.) works.

That's why I started this project, trying to implement a tiny HTTP server using Node.js.

Now it supports only very basic features: static files, simple MIME-types and several cache headers.
